This is a tiny example app made to show a few features of Ash. These features include:

* Core behavior like attributes/relationships
* Advanced core tools like calculations & aggregates
* AshAuthentication
* AshPhoenix tools to integrate with Phoenix
* AshAdmin
* PubSub Notifiers

This was made for a youtube video with LiveView Mastery and as such there aren't really any docs here. The idea is to provide the code for perusal, but I suggest watching the video (which should be out very soon!)

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
